The issue is that while the function works correctly for non-empty lists, it's susceptible to errors when the input list is empty.  The fix is to ensure the base case of the foldr is explicitly defined to handle an empty list correctly, ensuring 0 is returned instead of relying solely on the base case function. It is better to explicitly handle the empty list case to avoid unexpected behaviour.

```haskell
-- Correct foldr implementation
mySum :: [Int] -> Int
mySum [] = 0
mySum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (mySum [1,2,3,4,5]) -- Correct result: 15
  print (mySum [])          -- Correct result: 0
  print (mySum [1,2,3,4,5,0]) -- Correct result: 15
```
