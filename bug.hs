This Haskell code attempts to use the `foldr` function to compute the sum of a list of numbers. However, it contains a subtle error that can lead to unexpected results.  The error lies in the base case of the recursion.
```haskell
-- Incorrect foldr implementation
mySum :: [Int] -> Int
mySum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (mySum [1,2,3,4,5]) -- Correct result: 15
  print (mySum [])          -- Correct result: 0
  print (mySum [1,2,3,4,5,0]) -- Correct result: 15
```
